Monty Hall Problem

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem

Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. 
You pick a door, say No. 1. 
The host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. 
He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2? Or do you want to go with door No. 1?" 
What do you do?

Program:
The js app simulates the above game:
1. There are three doors to pick from. One has a treasure, the others have lemons (don't ask why I went with these options. Initially, instead of treasure I had gas/petrol can)
2. You choose any door you want.
3. The host will show you one of the remaining doors that has lemons.
4. Now you have to choose whether you will stay with your initial choice, or switch to the remaining door - which is unopened.

When Marilyn vos Savant, a high IQ autor/lecturer, suggested the player must always switch, it created a fair bit of controversy.

Now you can see if this is indeed the correct choice.

There is also a simulator included so you can see probabilistic values of both choices.

Have fun!

I made this to practice Javascript. If you have any suggestions about the code, would love to hear them.

WHAT I LEARNT:
1. DOM element selection - especially ignoring and picking clicks and using them as user inputs. A little more complex than taking input values from form fields 
2. DOM manipulation. Changing colors and values of buttons through classes, images, innterHTML content.
3. Appreciating the effort requried for clean up - like reseting colors at the start of a game, score content, modal behaviour, etc.
